# Lipidomics_PSanchoLab

This repository contains code and data for a lipidomics analysis project conducted by Andrés Gordo Ortiz (PSancho Lab).

## Overview

The project aims to analyze lipidomics data using various statistical and visualization techniques. It includes steps such as data tidying, quality checking of lipids, principal component analysis (PCA), identification of differentially expressed lipids (DELs), and heatmap visualization.

## Contents

- `code`: Contains R scripts for data tidying, quality checking, PCA, DEL analysis, and heatmap visualization.
- `data`: Includes raw and processed data files used in the analysis.
- `plots`: Contains visualizations generated during the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Analysis Workflow

The analysis workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Tidying**: Reads and preprocesses the lipidomics data.
2. **Quality Checking**: Conducts quality checks on the samples and lipid classes.
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Performs PCA to visualize the variation in the data.
4. **Differential Expression Analysis**: Identifies differentially expressed lipids between treatment groups.
5. **Heatmap Visualization**: Visualizes the expression patterns of lipids using heatmaps.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required R packages listed in the code files.
3. Run the R scripts in the `code` directory in the specified order to reproduce the analysis.
4. View the generated plots and analyze the results.
